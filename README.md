# myon - Implementation of the Quadratic Sieve / Number Field Sieve

This project is in early stages and currently not usable. It will be able to factor large integers using the Quadratic Sieve and the Number Field Sieve.

## Resources

These resources helped me during development. They are sometimes referenced in comments, so I know later where I got the algorithms from.
